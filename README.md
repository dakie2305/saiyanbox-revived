## Features

### Notable Traits

- Electro (NEW): Can use the power of electricity to electrocute their enemies and teleporting really fast on moving!

- Time Stopper (NEW): Will freeze enemies in time, or make them age faster and help unfreeze their allies in battle! Ultimate skill is wide spread time stop! 

- **The Tortured**  
  Eternal pain, hellfire, toxic air, and cursed immortality. Trapped in ice if not burning. Your children will inherit the suffering.
